    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! So a little about me - I'm an aspiring full-stack developer currently enrolled in
            a 6 month coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. While I can't say it's been easy working full-time,
            and taking on this much new materials, I can unaquivocally say it's been worth it. I'd like to take the skills
            I've learned (and am still learning) to transition into a junior developer role</p>

        <p>My hobbies include golf, snowboarding, gaming, coding, exercise, and (in case you couldn't tell by the theme) outdoors
            activities. I've been known to rock climb, whenever possible as well!</p>

        <p>While my current job focuses primary on using my communication skills and working in a team environment, I like the
            idea of being sit down and focus on my own project. I feel like I focus better in a quieter environment, but
            will not stray away from a conversation with my peers.</p>
